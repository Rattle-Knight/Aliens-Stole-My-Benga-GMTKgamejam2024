# **Aliens Stole My Benga!**

After being shrunk down by aliens hijacking your game of Benga, you must escape while they chase you down and try to atomize you. Scale your way through several levels as a de-scaled version of yourself. 
In Aliens Stole My Benga, you find yourself racing across a chaotic room where aliens have turned your favorite block-stacking game into an unpredictable battleground! The towering Jenga-like structures are just the beginningâ€”every part of the room is now a platforming challenge filled with danger and opportunity.
Leap across furniture, climb shelves, and swing from dangling wires to navigate this alien-occupied space. Dodge falling blocks, and use their Jenga or (Benga Blocks) chaos to your advantage as the environment shifts and crumbles around you. Each level pushes your platforming skills to the limit with creative obstacles and dynamic environments.
With fast-paced gameplay, vibrant visuals, and a quirky sense of humor, Aliens Stole My Benga combines the thrill of platforming with the madness of a room-turned-obstacle course. 
Can you outmaneuver the aliens and escape their game before it all comes crashing down?

This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2024.
